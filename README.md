# write-tm-exclusions

## Time Machine invisibly excludes files from backups, this commands shows you the files that are excluded.
You should be free to edit these files and add them to your backups, or take more out, though that doesn't make a lot of sense as there is an interface for doing so in your Preference Panes.

This is more just to see what the System has decided is not worthy of being backed up, just in case you were under the assumption something was backed up, but ended up not being.

Please feel free to offer suggestions, or pull the whole file and make fixes.  Supporting multiple files would be nice.  Right now, it takes drag and drop, and also has a Automator call that will show a notification center alert of what is going on.
